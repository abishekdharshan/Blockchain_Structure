# The Structure of a Simple Blockchain/Distributed Ledger

## Overview 

This code illustrates building a simple blockchain. [Here](https://github.com/howCodeORG/Simple-Python-Blockchain) is the original colab. 

## Dependencies

* hashlib
* datetime

Dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). However, you can run this directly in colab so there is no requirement to install anything.

## Usage 

You can download the juypter notebook and run it locally. Also, here is the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLAFXSa9S_R2CWLPNrPCJ05Px52FbQeI) link to run it in the browser (recommended).
